# Build a Raspberry OS Image for ioBroker

This script is used to auto generate preconfigured Raspberry OS Images for ioBroker IoT platform. For more details about ioBroker and the download of the last image see: [iobroker.net](https://www.iobroker.net/).

This build script uses the official Raspberry Pi OS build script from https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen. It takes the stages for the default Lite Image and adds a custom stage for setting up ioBroker.

## How to use
You can use this script to build your own ioBroker RaspberryPi OS image from source.

### Prerequisites
This script is made for running on a Linux Platform like Debian or Ubuntu.
Make sure you have Docker up and running. 

Clone the code to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/buanet/ioBroker.raspberry-os
```

### Starting build
Start the build process (from inside the cloned ioBroker.raspberry-os folder):
```
sudo ./build-iobrokerpi.sh
```
The script will download pi-gen source and start building.

After success you will find your Image in ```./pi-gen/deploy/```.

### Cleanup

Cleanup your workspace with the included cleanup script:
```
sudo ./cleanup.sh
```

## Configuration

You can configure settings like locales, default User and more by changing the ```config``` file. For details see the [pi-gen readme.md](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/master/README.md).
