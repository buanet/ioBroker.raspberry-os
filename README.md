This build uses the official Raspberry Pi OS build script from https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen. It takes the stages for the default lite image and adds a custom stage for setting up ioBroker.

## Build your own Raspberry OS image
Of course you can use this code to locally build your ioBroker RaspberryPi OS image from scratch. Take a look at https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen to learn how it works.
