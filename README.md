This repo is used to auto generate preconfigured Raspberry OS Images for ioBroker IoT platform. For more details about ioBroker and the download of the lastest image see: [iobroker.net](https://www.iobroker.net/).

This build uses the official Raspberry Pi OS build script from https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen. It takes the stages for the default lite image and adds a custom stage for setting up ioBroker.

***
## How to use
You can use this script to build your own ioBroker RaspberryPi OS image from source. 

### Prerequisites
This script is made for running on a Linux Platform like Debian or Ubuntu.
Make sure you have Docker up and running. 

Clone the code to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/buanet/ioBroker.raspberry-os
```

### Starting build
Start the build process (from inside the cloned ioBroker.raspberry-os folder):
```
sudo ./build-iobrokerpi.sh
```
The script will download pi-gen source and start building.

After success you will find your Image in ```./pi-gen/deploy/```.

### Cleanup

Cleanup your workspace with the included cleanup script:
```
sudo ./cleanup.sh
```

### Configuration

You can configure settings like locales, default User and more by changing the ```config``` file. For details see the [pi-gen readme.md](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/master/README.md).
