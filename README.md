This repo is used to auto generate preconfigured Raspberry OS images for ioBroker IoT platform. For more details about ioBroker and the download of the lastest image see: [iobroker.net](https://www.iobroker.net/).

This build uses the official Raspberry Pi OS build script from https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen. It takes the stages for the default lite image and adds a custom stage for setting up ioBroker.

## Build your own Raspberry OS image
Of course you can use this code to locally build your ioBroker RaspberryPi OS image from scratch.
This is how it works.

### Prerequisites
This script is made for running on a Linux Platform like Debian or Ubuntu.
As this build script is using Docker, make sure you have it up and running on your machine. 

Clone the code to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/buanet/ioBroker.raspberry-os
```

### Starting build
Start the build process (from inside the cloned ioBroker.raspberry-os folder):
```
sudo ./build-iobrokerpi.sh
```
The script will download pi-gen source and start building automatically.

Depending on your environment, the process can take some (more) time.

After success you will find your Image in ```./pi-gen/deploy/```.

### Cleanup
Cleanup your workspace with the included cleanup script. It will delete the pi-gen source and the used docker container.
```
sudo ./cleanup.sh
```

### Configuration
You can configure settings like locales, default User and more by editing the ```config``` file. For more details see the original [pi-gen readme.md](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/master/README.md).
